These include complex goal structures, natural language interfaces, and the ability to operate independently without constant user supervision. They often integrate various software tools to perform tasks. The concept has been compared to fictional AI like J.A.R.V.I.S. from popular media. AI agents lack a standardized definition but are categorized into types like business-task agents and conversational agents. Governments and organizations, such as the city of Kyle, Texas, have deployed AI agents for practical applications. Their roles range from enterprise software tasks to customer support.'"
